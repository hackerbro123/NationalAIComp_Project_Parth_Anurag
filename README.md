AAVS - Aerial Autonomous Vehicle System
What are we trying to do?
•	Our goal is to create an AI-based computer vision system to track vehicles. AAVS, our system, aims to be a general-purpose vehicle tracking system that could be used from parking lots to toll booths. With higher-feature versions, the system could even be used by police to detect vehicles and conduct vehicle detection without needing manual equipment or checking. AAVS aims to become a useful, integrated system that could make many facets of vehicle use more streamlined and safe.

How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
====================================================================

•	Today, there is no general-purpose AI system used for this purpose. A templatized, general system that could be used in any number of cases would increase the fruitfulness of several use cases, like automated parking or security clearance for vehicles. Since it is general-purpose, it could be adapted for specific uses, but we believe that this fulfils a demand for a general system that has not been implemented before.

What is new in our approach and why do we think it will be successful?
=========================================================================
•	Our approach aims to be nearly fully automated, something that we believe is a transition that society as a whole should make soon. A fully automated or quasi-automated system would perform wonders in that it would not require a surplus of manpower or maintenance, and it would be seamless and effective.

Who cares? If You are successful, what difference will it make?
====================================================================
•	AAVS would be of big help to both the private and public sectors. Cars and Vehicles need to be monitored and monitored effectively. Both private and public stakeholders would reap the benefits of a quintessential system that could be adapted to nearly any situation, whether that be a home-vehicle security system based on AAVS or a police car-chase drone. 

What are the risks?
====================================================================
•	Privacy and Security are certainly a risk. For one, Microsoft's responsible AI principles dictate that privacy and security are imperative and fundamental considerations in building AI systems. The PeekingDuck framework has many facets that could help this, like the mosaic blur, which could be implemented with just one line of code. Overall, while this is a risk, we believe that if carefully handled, it can be mitigated.

How much will it cost?
====================================================================
•	An estimate for the cost of a fully made system is difficult to procure, but an analysis of other similar systems may help us. Home security companies that often lack a vehicle tracking service based on AI such as Vivint charge 30 USD/month for a basic system. A system specifically for vehicle safety like AAVS's cost would vary depending on how it was implemented, but a static, average-scale implementation could be a subscription service of 20 USD/month. Analysing Vivint's Quarterly Key Financial and Portfolio Metric, a budget of 75,000 USD could allow us to break even in a time of 4 months and allow a furbished and polished product.

How long will it take?
====================================================================
•	The development of this project would require around 14 months.

What are the mid- term and final “exams” to check for AAVS's success?
=======================================================================
•	We are strong believers that computer testing is crucial for success. Passing whitebox and blackbox testing would be the first step; we think automated user testing along with making sure the system works for 3 main examples of systems (generally): home security, larger lot-based security, and toll booths, we would have cleared our general goal. All other systems could be created using AAVS's templatized nature.
